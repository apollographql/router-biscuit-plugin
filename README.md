# Biscuit router plugin

This router plugin tests authorization with [Biscuit tokens](https://www.biscuitsec.org/), which support
public key signatures and offline attenuatin, along with a Datalog based authorization language.

The goal here is to explore authorization patterns.

## Setup

### Install the biscuit CLI

Install the biscuit CLI with `cargo install biscuit-cli` or download the [latest release](https://github.com/biscuit-auth/biscuit-cli/releases).

### Generate the root key pair

This will be used to mint and verify tokens.

```shell
$ biscuit keypair
Generating a new random keypair
Private key: d6f6ba4981352d4d1c23693d04063b956a0d7d7330f5873ffce3df581449d18b
Public key: 36ba0f350d7605e4e4f724f108594cf7ddf55037728d5735cbb9b58366801170
```

Then create the router configuration file with the public key:

```yaml
plugins:
  biscuit.auth:
    public_root: "36ba0f350d7605e4e4f724f108594cf7ddf55037728d5735cbb9b58366801170"
```

### Add the authorization policies to the router

The plugin automatically adds the following facts that you can use in token checks:
- `query("root_operation_name")` or `mutation("root_operation_name")`
- `time(2022-09-27T12:00:00Z)`

The policies are added as follows:

```yaml
plugins:
  biscuit.auth:
    public_root: "36ba0f350d7605e4e4f724f108594cf7ddf55037728d5735cbb9b58366801170"
    code: authorizer.datalog
```

And the `authorizer.datalog` file:

```datalog
// allow introspection
allow if query("__schema");

allow if user($id);
// only the test root operation is available as unauthenticated user
deny if query($op), !($op == "test");
allow if true;
```

Here we check for the presence of a `user` fact, that would be provided by the token,
and if that policy does not match, we then try the next one. That next policy will
reject unauthenticated queries using any root operation other than `test`.

### Create a token

Using the root private key we generated previously, we will now create a token:

```shell
$ biscuit generate --private-key d6f6ba4981352d4d1c23693d04063b956a0d7d7330f5873ffce3df581449d18b -
Please input a datalog program, followed by <enter> and ^D
user(1);

Please input a datalog program, followed by <enter> and ^D
user(1);
```

You can verify the token and print its content like this:

```shell
$ biscuit inspect --public-key "36ba0f350d7605e4e4f724f108594cf7ddf55037728d5735cbb9b58366801170" token.bc

### Start the router

We are using the [federation-demo](https://github.com/apollographql/federation-demo) for this test:

```shell
$ cargo run -- -s local.graphql -c router.yaml
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.14s
     Running `target/debug/router -s local.graphql -c router.yaml`
2022-09-27T12:46:17.574756Z  INFO Apollo Router v1.0.0 // (c) Apollo Graph, Inc. // Licensed as ELv2 (https://go.apollo.dev/elv2)

```

### Unauthenticated query

If we try to do the following query:

```graphql
query {
  me {
    name
  }

  topProducts {
    name
  }
}
```

That can be tested from Studio or with curl as follows:

```shell
curl --request POST \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --url 'http://127.0.0.1:4000/' \
    --data '{"query":"query {\n  me {\n    name\n  }\n\n  topProducts {\n    name\n  }\n}","variables":{}}'
```

We get this result, as expected:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "authorization failed"
    }
  ]
}
```

The plugin printed this message, telling us about the authorizer's state and which checks or policies failed:

```
authorizer result Err(FailedLogic(Unauthorized { policy: Deny(2), checks: [] })):
World {
  facts: {
    Origin {
        inner: {
            18446744073709551615,
        },
    }: [
        "query(\"topProducts\")",
        "time(2022-09-27T12:51:58Z)",
        "query(\"me\")",
    ],
}
  rules: {}
  checks: []
  policies: [
    "allow if query(\"__schema\")",
    "allow if user($id)",
    "deny if query($op), !($op == \"test\")",
    "allow if true",
]
}
```

So it's the third policy (zero indexed) that failed: `deny if query($op), !($op == "test")`

### Authenticated query

Now we will use the token we created, by passing it in the `Authorization` header, with the
value `Bearer EnYKDBgDIggKBggKEgIQARIkCAASIK8bnAXtqMr3ZGaahJiF2eWh0MMdWqLg3X9Ld0yEcIvOGkAZqkSfOF0-DA9RgiLuGSUR2OL3yeVs_2mv2VSd1cQP3vDHhKWYt-AkGEPVABnz88J-fjsCZj65-Q2bhc6rK0QOIiIKIMaYRKo660tMRrl2u3spCTDD4q9WXc9-vtS2-_0Rn7So`.

This translates to this curl request:

```shell
curl --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer EnYKDBgDIggKBggKEgIQARIkCAASIK8bnAXtqMr3ZGaahJiF2eWh0MMdWqLg3X9Ld0yEcIvOGkAZqkSfOF0-DA9RgiLuGSUR2OL3yeVs_2mv2VSd1cQP3vDHhKWYt-AkGEPVABnz88J-fjsCZj65-Q2bhc6rK0QOIiIKIMaYRKo660tMRrl2u3spCTDD4q9WXc9-vtS2-_0Rn7So' \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --url 'http://127.0.0.1:4000/' \
    --data '{"query":"query {\n  me {\n    name\n  }\n\n  topProducts {\n    name\n  }\n}","variables":{}}'
```

and gives us this result:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "me": {
      "name": "Ada Lovelace"
    },
    "topProducts": [
      {
        "name": "Table"
      },
      {
        "name": "Couch"
      },
      {
        "name": "Chair"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Great, now we can authorize queries according to policies that valid the root operation.
But can we go further?

### Authenticated query with an attenuated token

One of the main features of Biscuit tokens is attenuation: from an existing token, it is
possible to create a new one with less rights, without even going through the service that
created the token. The main policies will still apply, but you can add as many restrictions
as you want.

So let's attenuate our token. We will add two restrictions to our token:
- we only accept the `me` root operation, `__schema` for introspection and `_entities` for federation
- we set an expiration date

```shell
$ biscuit attenuate --block 'check all query($op), ["__schema", "_entities", "me"].contains($op); check if time($time), $time < 2022-09-30T16:32:00Z'  token.bc > attenuated_token.bc
# inspecting it
$ biscuit inspect --public-key "36ba0f350d7605e4e4f724f108594cf7ddf55037728d5735cbb9b58366801170" attenuated_token.bc

==========

‚úÖ Public key check succeeded üîë
üôà Datalog check skipped üõ°Ô∏è
```

Now if we try to query `me` and `topProducts`:

```shell
curl --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer EnYKDBgDIggKBggKEgIQARIkCAASIK8bnAXtqMr3ZGaahJiF2eWh0MMdWqLg3X9Ld0yEcIvOGkAZqkSfOF0-DA9RgiLuGSUR2OL3yeVs_2mv2VSd1cQP3vDHhKWYt-AkGEPVABnz88J-fjsCZj65-Q2bhc6rK0QOGugBCn4KAm9wCghfX3NjaGVtYQoJX2VudGl0aWVzCgJtZRgDMjUKMQoCCBsSBwgbEgMIgAgaIgoTChE6DwoDGIEICgMYgggKAxiDCAoFCgMIgAgKBBoCCAUQATImCiQKAggbEgYIBRICCAUaFgoECgIIBQoICgYggLTcmQYKBBoCCAASJAgAEiB3lMQWAKUvwsMc4XnwY-HdHQySrS9V1U40vHOspX9-EBpAPenytLBWkmU5KBuKbQRfIZYv5FUpBEF5CzGF99M-qtH-Jt263JUemoWy4avRUzWfloVXkKbpMEiSQNTimrtRDiIiCiBO8Eb6ZM5-qi9NVJxZ20xl3MeskbRcLpIUtF6CWg1aKQ==' \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --url 'http://127.0.0.1:4000/' \
    --data '{"query":"query ExampleQuery {\n  me {\n    name\n  }\n\n  topProducts {\n    name\n  }\n}","variables":{}}'
```

We will get as expected:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "authorization failed"
    }
  ]
}
```

And we see in the logs:

```
authorizer result Err(FailedLogic(Unauthorized { policy: Allow(1), checks: [Block(FailedBlockCheck { block_id: 1, check_id: 0, rule: "check all query($op), [\"me\", \"__schema\"].contains($op)" })] }))
```

While if we did a query only for `me`:

```shell
curl --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer EnYKDBgDIggKBggKEgIQARIkCAASIK8bnAXtqMr3ZGaahJiF2eWh0MMdWqLg3X9Ld0yEcIvOGkAZqkSfOF0-DA9RgiLuGSUR2OL3yeVs_2mv2VSd1cQP3vDHhKWYt-AkGEPVABnz88J-fjsCZj65-Q2bhc6rK0QOGtgBCm4KAm9wCghfX3NjaGVtYQoCbWUYAzIwCiwKAggbEgcIGxIDCIAIGh0KDgoMOgoKAxiBCAoDGIIICgUKAwiACAoEGgIIBRABMiYKJAoCCBsSBggFEgIIBRoWCgQKAggFCggKBiCAtNyZBgoEGgIIABIkCAASIJe_J6Gx9s79Oxq9EmzQLA1ypWii1lUVpoSyJTCL8KQ-GkD_GLs5EXa21wcO7MXkJpczSLOmjgHB-XAZTN9dxx_KfpPHv83kNJuX5KWoLBHNVUvOHPze8jZzcuuspG782jwBIiIKIGeQ8Z2YMHvHafQSpQmGL-x1C5uLpGOr8HlZKN1Q-oj1' \

    --url 'http://127.0.0.1:4000/' \
    --data '{"query":"query ExampleQuery {\n  me {\n    name\n  }\n}","variables":{}}'
```

The query succeeds and we receive:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "me": {
      "name": "Ada Lovelace"
    }
  }
}
```

### Attenuated queries to subgraphs

The router automatically attenuates the token before sending it to the subgraph,
by adding (here for the `products` subgraph) the check `check if subgraph("products)`.
It assumes that each subgraph will authorize the query, and provide the `subgraph` fact
to the authorizer.

This has two consequences:
- if the subgraph is compromised and the token stolen to query another subgraph, it won't work
because other subgraphs will have different names
- if the token is stolen, it cannot be used to query the router either, because the router's
authorizer does not provide the  `subgraph` fact

Let's try: we extracted the subgtraph sent to the user backend in `subgraph.bc`, if we inspect it,
we see:

```shell
Authority block:
== Datalog ==
user(1);

== Revocation id ==
19aa449f385d3e0c0f518222ee192511d8e2f7c9e56cff69afd9549dd5c40fdef0c784a598b7e0241843d50019f3f3c27e7e3b02663eb9f90d9b85ceab2b440e

==========

Block n¬∞1:
== Datalog ==
check all query($op), ["__schema", "_entities", "me"].contains($op);
check if time($time), $time < 2022-09-30T16:32:00Z;

== Revocation id ==
3de9f2b4b056926539281b8a6d045f21962fe455290441790b3185f7d33eaad1fe26ddbadc951e9a85b2e1abd153359f96855790a6e930489240d4e29abb510e

==========

Block n¬∞2:
== Datalog ==
check if subgraph("user");

== Revocation id ==
b1c8fbc5261d50e685b58a23c74e3bf660e3c66df3773e17b59169929af2285cab522e52fb99d531f7206c289ab1dcb29054f2a3bdd40b33da730b2b60b1da00

==========

‚úÖ Public key check succeeded üîë
üôà Datalog check skipped üõ°Ô∏è
```

The third block contains the check `check if subgraph("user")`. Now if we try to use itto query the router, we get the
"authorization failed" message, and in the router's logs:

```
authorizer result Err(FailedLogic(Unauthorized { policy: Allow(1), checks: [Block(FailedBlockCheck { block_id: 2, check_id: 0, rule: "check if subgraph(\"user\")" })] }))```

This check fails because the router does not provide the subgraph fact.


## Experimentations

### Router level authorization on the request

The router verifies that the root operations are in a set of authorized operations.
The token provides the list of authorized operations as a fact containing a set.
If the token is attenuated to remove operations, this should be validated as well.

### Subgraph query attenuation

The router will take the client provided token, and send it to the subgraph so it can
authorize queries too. But what happens if a subgraph is compromised? Can they take
that token and query the router, or other subgraphs?

Using attenuation, the router mints a token that can only be used to query the subgraph,
and that would not be authorized when querying the router or another subgraph.

### Router level filtering on the response

The token or authorizer policies provide fine grained rules on what kind of information
is available.

Examples:
- the `User` type contains a `private` field that is accessible
if the token provided user id matches the one of the `User` object
- the organization has a `private` field only accessible if the
 token provided user id matches a user that belongs to the organization

### Third party blocks (not tested yet)

The upcoming [third party blocks](https://github.com/biscuit-auth/biscuit/issues/88) feature
will allow a token to bring in data signed by external keys, and authorizers to add expectations
on that data. This could solve an issue that we will see with supergraphs created with graphs
from various companies: the usual authorization systems would give too much power to the token
creator, because it could get full access to anything in the subgraphs.

With third party blocks, we could have a token that is assembled from a token created by the
router's authorization server, and then an aggregation of third party blocks for the various
subgraphs, obtained from each of the companies with the user's identity. That way they would
have fine grained way to reduces the rights of the user, independently of the router's
authorization server.
